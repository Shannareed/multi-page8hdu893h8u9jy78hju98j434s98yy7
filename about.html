Hello my name is Shanna Reed and this is my Cap Stone Project. <br><br>
    The project itself was inspired by my sisters brand Shhh Shoetique.
    <br><br>
This Project demonstrates all the elements I have learned during my time with Codex.
<br><br>
This would include HTML, CSS, Javascript and everyones favorite Bootstrap.
    <br><br>
  The difference between the initial multipage website is that this page has (CSS,JAVA,BOOTSTRAP). The initial page only contained HTML. Also this page is deployed to <b>GITHUB.</b>
