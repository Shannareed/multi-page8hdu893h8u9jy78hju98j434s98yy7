Hello my name is Shanna Reed and this is my Cap Stone Project. <br><br>
     
    
     The project itself was inspired by my sisters brand Shhh Shoetique.
    <br><br>
This Project demonstrates all the elements I have learned during my time with Codex.
<br><br>
This would include HTML, CSS, Javascript and everyones favorite Bootstrap.
    <br><br>
  The difference between the initial multipage website is that this page has (CSS,JAVA,BOOTSTRAP). The initial page only contained HTML. Also this page is deployed to <b>GITHUB.</b><br><br>
    <b>BOOTSTRAP</b><br>
      <u>Alert</u> is used on the contact page.
      That was used by linking the bootstap in the head tag of the page.<br>
   <u>Spinner</u> used by linking the bootstrap in the head tag of the page. It is demonstrated on the home page to cause attention to the faux raffle.<br>
   <u>Card</u> is used on the Contact page. using bootstrap element 
   
   
   
   <b>GITHUB</b>
   I deployed my website to GITHUB by creating first creating a GITHUB account using an email, made a NEW REPOSITORY,
   on GLITCH I created an README.md page with commands I used the terminal .
   
   copied an access code.
   
   <br><br>
   
   <b>Boiler Plate</b> was used on each page. here it is demonstrated:<br><br>

   <br><br>
   <b>Radio Buttons </b> were used on the home page. It is using a rating system to rate my site which I hope you enjoy !<br><br>
