Hello my name is Shanna Reed and this is my Cap Stone Project. <br><br>
     
    
     The project itself was inspired by my sisters brand Shhh Shoetique.
    <br><br>
This Project demonstrates all the elements I have learned during my time with Codex.
<br><br>
This would include HTML, CSS, Javascript and everyones favorite Bootstrap.
    <br><br>
  The difference between the initial multipage website is that this page has (CSS,JAVA,BOOTSTRAP). The initial page only contained HTML. Also this page is deployed to <b>GITHUB.</b><br><br>
    <b>BOOTSTRAP</b><br>
      <u>Alert</u> is used on the contact page.
      That was used by linking the bootstap in the head tag of the page.<br><br>
   <u>Spinner</u> used by linking the bootstrap in the head tag of the page. It is demonstrated on the home page to cause attention to the faux raffle.<br><br>
   <u>Card</u> is used on the Contact page. using bootstrap element 
   <br><br>
   
   
   <b>GITHUB</b>
   I deployed my website to GITHUB by creating first creating a GITHUB account using an email, made a NEW REPOSITORY,
   on GLITCH I created an README.md page with commands I used the terminal .
   
   copied an access code.
   
   <br><br>
   
   <u>Boiler Plate</u> was used on each page. here it is demonstrated:<br><br>
   <img alt="picture of boiler plate template" width="250px" height="250px" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/a7f5552b-8281-46c9-b9bf-86470c98648d/IMG_3528.jpg?v=1726137006321">
   <br><br>
   <u>Radio Buttons </u> were used on the home page. It is using a rating system to rate my site which I hope you enjoy !<br><br>
   <u>CSS Units </u> I prefer using px which was demonstrated on my boiler plate photo =]
   <br><br>
   <u>CSS Selectors/External CSS</u> I did use external css. index.html has a link inside the head tag. <br><br>
   <u>Internal CSS</u> is when the style tag is used with in the same html page. It is used on this page nested in the head tag.
   <u></u>
   <b>JAVASCRIPT</b>
   <u>Button</u> I have a running function on the index page to enter the raffle when the button is pressed you are prompted to enter your email.
      </p>
